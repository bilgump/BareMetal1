# STM32F407 Scheduler Project:

A bare-metal task scheduler for STM32F407, built with timers and interrupts (no RTOS).

# FEATURES:

**Task Scheduler Library**
  - Register and deregister tasks  
  - Each task is driven by its own hardware timer for precise timing  

**Finite State Machines (FSM)**
  - Button Debounce **FSM** (states: Idle -> MaybePressed -> Pressed -> Released)  
  - **Sleep-Mode FSM** triggered by button interrupt

**Peripheral Drivers**
  - **SPI** driver for Winbond W25X20CL flash: read/write operations
  - **ADC** task reading internal temperature sensor
  - **USB CDC** for PC data logging

**Example Tasks**
  - LED blink task
  - Temperature-read task
